Solution:
	
	Puzzle 1: Initially, the lamp is turned off. In the right cabinet of desk, push button. Lamp comes on. Books marked with X's
		  are the ones you need to pull until they lock in place. Once all are locked in place, the bookshelf opens.

	Puzzle 2: Initially, one button is on (green). It is the wrong button. Select other button, turn wheel which opens panel blocking the light.
		  Now, select button that was initially green. Rotate and it will rotate the arch that changes the shadow on opposite wall. Once
		  arch shadow lines up with arch on that wall, a green "portal" appears showing you have won the puzzle.

	Win Conditions: If the time runs out and you haven't solved the puzzles, then text will show up saying you lose. If you win, the text says you win. 
					In either case, you can no longer give the game input and happen to "solve" the puzzle after the time has run out.

Controls:

	Teleportation: Touchpad - press down, hold, release at target destination

	Selection: Right Trigger - Select object (it is boolean so you just have to click down). Once you are done manipulating, click again to deselect.

Selection/Manipulation 1:

	Selecting a book directly with controller. Then translating its position for manipulation.

Selection/Manipulation 2:

	Selecting either the wall panel or arch via a button. Then translating its position(wall panel) or rotation (arch) for manipulation.
